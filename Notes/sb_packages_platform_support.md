- ⚠️ **Limited support**: The package may work but with some limitations
- ❌ **Not supported**: The package does not work on this platform

## Windows Platform Support Summary

- ✅ Fully supported: 84 packages
- ⚠️ Limited support: 8 packages
- ❌ Not supported: 10 packages

## Adding Windows Platform Support

### Required Work:

- Review and replace packages/plugins that are not supported on Windows (High)
- Verify and configure supported packages/plugins according to Windows documentation (Medium)
- Adjust UI/UX for Windows POS use, as the current design targets Android-based POS devices and tablets (e.g., touch interfaces, fixed orientations, mobile navigation paradigms) (Medium)
- Rewrite native logic if using `MethodChannel` that has no Windows implementation (High)

### Challenges:

- `flutter_nuvei_sdk`: This package was built to support Simply Connect SDK from Nuvei for handling forms, card info management, and online payments. Current issue: No documentation found for Windows support. => Need to confirm with Nuvei.
- Some specialized packages/plugins may have no alternatives => May require disabling some features conditionally on Windows.

## Risk Summary

| Risk / Blocker                   | Description                                          | Mitigation                                     |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `flutter_nuvei_sdk` unknown      | No confirmation of SDK support for Windows           | Contact Nuvei, propose web wrapper as fallback |
| No plugin alternative            | Some Android/iOS-only plugins cannot be ported       | Temporarily disable feature or rebuild plugin  |
| UX non-optimized for Windows POS | App may feel overly tailored for Android POS/tablets | Adjust layout, navigation, scaling             |
| Testing surface increases        | Now needs Windows regression testing                 | Add Windows test plan                          |

> **Note:** Certain Android POS/tablet-oriented interactions (e.g., swipe to refresh, biometric auth, touch-first navigation) may not be applicable or available on Windows POS systems, and may need alternative UX.

## Conclusion

- The current app is built with a strong base of platform-agnostic Dart packages and Platform-dependent plugins that mostly support Windows.
- About 84% of packages used are fully compatible with Windows.
- A few mobile-focused plugins will require replacement or disabling for Windows builds.
- The feasibility of building the app for Windows is approximately 50-50. It depends heavily on whether Nuvei provides Windows SDK support, and whether replacement packages/plugins for unsupported ones integrate reliably with the existing Android and iOS app structure.
